# TG-bot-with-ChatGPT
This repository contains code for creating your own Telegram bot based on ChatGPT 3.5.

This bot allows you to restrict access to users who have permission to use it. Only users whose IDs are added to the White List have access to the bot.

One limitation of the bot is that it doesn't maintain context and only responds to the most recent question.

To make it work correctly, you need to have API keys from both ChatGPT and Telegram.
